                        <span class="content">As a member of the Virginia Tech Systems & Storage Laboratory (DSSL), under the guidance of Dr. Ali Butt and in collaboration with Yuze Li, I completed an experiment focused on optimizing memory access in Python code. By implementing code-level optimizations, we significantly enhanced the utilization efficiency of both DRAM and XRAM. This involved adjusting the code to optimize memory allocation and access patterns, thereby fully leveraging the high bandwidth of DRAM and the low latency of XRAM, ultimately resulting in substantial performance improvements.</span>

                        <span class="content">Piazza is widely used at our school for student-teacher communication. Our analysis shows that around 65% of student questions are basic concepts, and we've identified some platform limitations. To improve this, we plan to create a new website with three features: using OpenAI to guide students step-by-step, providing similar past questions and answers, and helping students find relevant YouTube instructional videos.</span>
